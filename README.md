# Notepad

Hello

My Name is Haseebullah. 

This is a C++ Notepad Project. 

It uses the Concepts of Data Structures & Algorithms. 

Every Character is stored in a Separate Node. 

All Nodes are Interconnected with each other using Doubly Linked List having next,previous,up,down Links. 

The Notepad can be Saved in a File, and can also Read/Import from the File. 

You can Move the Pointer Cursor Left, Right, Up, and Down anywhere in the Notepad.
